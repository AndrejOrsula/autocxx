# Safety

This crate mostly intends to follow the lead of the `cxx` crate in where and when `unsafe` is required. But, this crate is opinionated. It believes some unsafety requires more careful review than other bits, along the following spectrum:

* Rust unsafe code (requires most review)
* Rust code calling C++ with raw pointers
* Rust code calling C++ with shared pointers, or anything else where there can be concurrent mutation
* Rust code calling C++ with unique pointers, where the Rust single-owner model nearly always applies (but we can't _prove_ that the C++ developer isn't doing something weird)
* Rust safe code (requires least review)

If your project is 90% Rust code, with small bits of C++, don't use this crate. You need something where all C++ interaction is marked with big red "this is terrifying" flags. This crate is aimed at cases where there's 90% C++ and small bits of Rust, and so we want the Rust code to be pragmatically reviewable without the signal:noise ratio of `unsafe` in the Rust code becoming so bad that `unsafe` loses all value.

See [safety!] in the documentation for more details.
